# Fisho_game_of_three_numbers.Ethio
This is the project I have done for the first time by using my amateur python programming skill.

The principle of the game.

It takes the average of three numbers and if the mean or average value is great than at least two of the given three values the player wins the game.

Good luck ðŸ¤ž
